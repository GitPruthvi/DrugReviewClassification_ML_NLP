# Drug Review Classification

#### The main motivation behind this project is to understand “How can the drug manufacturers understand the sentiments behind thousands of reviews from patients in more efficient and quicker way that can help them in making decisions to improve their drugs”. 

#### My aim for this project is to classify drug reviews into two classes such as positive and negative review based on the patient review. This way, the companies who are manufacturing such different drugs for different medication can interpret what does the patient think about their drugs based on their review, if these drugs are helping them or not, and if they would recommend their drugs to other similar patients or not having similar health condition. 

#### This project was implemented end-to-end with deployment in Heroku PAAS using Flask framework. One can interact with the model using the link given below -
